Clustering-via-Jenks-Natural-Breaks-Arduino

This code shows how to cluster a one-dimensional array into two classes based on Jenks Natural Breaks optimization method. 

The method is unsupervised and depends on statistical similarites between samples

input: one-dimensional data array 
output: 
- array 1: elements belonging to class 1
- array 2: elements belonging to class 2
